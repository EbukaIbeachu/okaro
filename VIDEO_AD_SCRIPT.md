## Production Notes for Screen Recording:
1.  **Occupancy Shot:** Ensure you use the "MMADUABUCHI LODGE" page where we fixed the calculation to show a realistic number (e.g., 90% instead of 100% if applicable).
2.  **Privacy:** Ensure no real tenant emails are visible during recording (use the dummy data we created).
3.  **Browser:** Record in Full Screen (F11) with no bookmarks bar visible for a clean look.
